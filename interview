Q: Which of your weaknesses have most limited your ability to succeed at work, home or school?

With this new work, I will have the opportunity to learn the job the way you want it done, not the way a different organization does it. 
I am never bored because there is always something new to learn. In addition, although I have no former on-the-job experience with this 
work, I do bring my love of learning new things, which can only enhance my ability to learn this process very quickly. And, I've always 
been commended by my managers for my commitment to work hard. I'm always on time and not a slacker.

Q: Describe your ideal job.

I would describe the ideal job as a job that makes the most of my qualifications and abilities and gives me a chance to constantly 
challenge myself. I look for a stable job with quality supervision, a positive work culture at a successful company that will encourage me 
to work at my best.
